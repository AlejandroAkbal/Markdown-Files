# Introduction

This complete tutorial will aid you in setting up a secure Ubuntu server from scratch.

Keep in mind that this is not a common tutorial, this is the culmination of all the knowledge I have gathered from managing my own servers for more than two years.

## 0. Before we start

### Preface

While this tutorial is focused on Ubuntu 20.04, it can be used for many other versions, like 18.04 and 16.04. As they are very similar.

### Requisites

- An Ubuntu server
- Credentials to your server

_It doesn't matter if your server is hosted on DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Engine or Amazon Web Services, Ubuntu should be the same._

### Requisites info

If you don't have a server you might want to look at the [Useful resources](#useful-resources) step.

## Updates

The first and probably most important step is to always keep the system up to date. To do so just open the terminal to update and upgrade our packages via [apt](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-apt-command/).

```sh
sudo apt update           # Update package information
sudo apt full-upgrade -y  # Upgrade packages
sudo apt autoremove -y    # Remove unnecessary packages

# One liner
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
```

---

## Automatic updates

Now that our packages are updated, we should install an automated solution to keep our system always up to date.

[This tutorial on Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-up-automatic-updates-on-ubuntu-18-04/) will help you install and configure the `unattended-upgrades` package, which is exactly what we need.
