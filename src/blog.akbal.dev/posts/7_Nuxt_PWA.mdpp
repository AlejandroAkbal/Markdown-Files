Title: Detect and update to the latest version with Nuxt PWA
Tags: tutorial, vue, nuxt, blog

# Introduction

I was working on one of my Nuxt projects and noticed that some users were using old versions, which was causing some errors to pop up.

I investigated and learned that sometimes PWAs don't update if the user doesn't manually refresh the website. So...

**Let's learn how to automatically update to the latest PWA version.**

---

## Before we start

This is a simple tutorial for projects with Nuxt and the PWA module, nothing else is required.

### Requirements

- Nuxt
- Nuxt PWA module

---

## Create a new plugin

To start, you will need to go to your plugins directory and create a new JavaScript file. I will name it `pwa-update.js` but feel free to use whatever you want to.

```js
// pwa-update.js

export default async (context) => {
  const workbox = await window.$workbox;

  if (!workbox) {
    console.debug("Workbox couldn't be loaded.");
    return;
  }

  workbox.addEventListener('installed', (event) => {
    if (!event.isUpdate) {
      console.debug('The PWA is on the latest version.');
      return;
    }

    console.debug('There is an update for the PWA, reloading...');
    window.location.reload();
  });
};
```

---

## Add the plugin to the Nuxt config

Then we have to add it to the plugins array on `nuxt.config.js`.

```js
// nuxt.config.js

// ...

  plugins: [
    { src: '~/plugins/pwa-update.js', mode: 'client' },
  ],

// ...
```

---

## End

And that was it. Easy right?
