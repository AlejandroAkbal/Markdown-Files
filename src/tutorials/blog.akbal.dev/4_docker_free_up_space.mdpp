# Introduction

Chances are that you've been running Docker for some time and found out that your system's storage is almost full.

This is completely normal as Docker bundles all the needed dependencies with each container and doesn't remove anything if you don't explicitly tell it to do so.

So lets learn how to prune unused and unnecessary **images, containers, volumes and networks**!

> This tutorial will help you liberate space on your system without breaking anything in the process.

---

## Before we start

We will be using the Docker CLI, so I expect you to be a bit familiar with it.

Otherwise just use `docker --help` on the terminal and toy with it a little.

### Requisites

- A little bit of Docker knowledge

---

## Images

Remove all images that are not tagged or referenced by any container

```sh
docker image prune
```

---

## Containers

Remove all stopped containers

```sh
docker container prune
```

---

## Volumes

Remove all volumes not used by at least one container

```sh
docker volume prune
```

---

## Networks

Remove all networks not used by at least one container

```sh
docker network prune
```

---

## Everything

To finalize, lets remove everything --_but volumes_-- with a single command.

```sh
docker system prune
```

If you want to remove volumes too, just append `--volumes` at the end.

```sh
docker system prune --volumes
```

**And voila, that removed every single resource that was unnecessary on your system!**

---

## Troubleshooting

You might find that some images can't be removed because they are used. In this case you want to remove the resource that is using it, most likely a container.
