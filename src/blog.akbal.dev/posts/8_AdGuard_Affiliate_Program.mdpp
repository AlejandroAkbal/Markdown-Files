# Introduction

Chances are that you want to monetize your audience, and you have learned about the **[50% lifetime commissions on the AdGuard Affiliate Program](https://aff.adguard.com/?ref=AlejandroAkbal)**.

**So let's learn everything about the affiliate / referral program.**

## How it works

When you become an AdGuard affiliate, you will earn 50% of the purchases that your referred users make.

The process looks like this:

- You share your referral link to your audience
- A user installs AdGuard using your link
- The user makes a purchase and activates the program with it
- At the moment of activation, you will earn 50% of the revenue
- You will also earn 50% from the following renewals

It does not matter when and how a user purchases the license key.
**The important thing is that a user has installed AdGuard with your link.**
