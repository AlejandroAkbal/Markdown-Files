# Introduction

This tutorial will help you to set up a secure Ubuntu server from scratch.

Keep in mind that this is not a common tutorial, **this is the culmination of all the knowledge I have gathered from managing my own servers** for more than three years.

## Before we start

### Preface

While this tutorial is focused on **Ubuntu 20.04**, it can be used for many other versions, like 18.04 and 16.04. As they are very similar.

### Requisites

- An Ubuntu server
- Access to your server

_It doesn't matter if your server is hosted on DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Engine or Amazon Web Services, Ubuntu should be the same._

### Requisite info

If you don't have a server you might want to look at the [Useful resources](#useful-resources) step.

## Updates

The first and probably most important step is to **always keep the system up-to-date**. To do so just open the terminal to update and upgrade the packages via [apt](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-apt-command/).

```sh
sudo apt update           # Update package information
sudo apt full-upgrade -y  # Upgrade packages
sudo apt autoremove -y    # Remove unnecessary packages

# One liner
sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
```

---

## Automatic updates

Now that the packages are updated, we should install an automated solution to keep the system always up-to-date.

[This tutorial on Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-up-automatic-updates-on-ubuntu-18-04/) will help you install and configure the `unattended-upgrades` package, which is exactly what is needed.

---

## New user

Using the default super user `root` is always **bad practice**, it does everything with the maximum level of permissions, allowing you to break anything; and more critically... _Access to anything on the system_.

Instead, we should use a normal user with super user **privileges**. [This tutorial on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-new-sudo-enabled-user-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart) will guide you to do that.

---

## SSH credentials

Now that you have a new user with super user privileges, you might want to SSH in your server with it, _but might find that you can't_.

This is because the credentials were stored on the user you were using before, most likely `root`. Just SSH again with the previous user and copy the credentials to the new user with the `rsync` utility package.

Follow the **5th step** of [this tutorial on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04#if-the-root-account-uses-ssh-key-authentication) to do so.

---

## SSHD

SSHD manages the SSH connections to the server. Its default configuration is good but some changes must be made, like disabling the `root` user login and changing the default `SSH` port.

Follow the **first step** [of this tutorial on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-harden-openssh-on-ubuntu-18-04) to learn how to configure SSHD.

> It is recommended that you change the default `SSH` port
